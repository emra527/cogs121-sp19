## Project proposal
Our project idea will involve using datasets for art museums across the United
States in an application that can be used by educators to plan field trips to museums.
Educators will be able to plan distinct routes within the museum for their students to
follow, and students will be able to pull up the route to check their progress on the
trip. Each stop will give detailed information about each art piece to aid their learning.
We do not have a strong understanding of the arts nor disciplinary knowledge in the subject
to say we are part of the user population. This will help out educators and
primary education students to have a more interactive learning experience without an extra
cost.

The data can be used to help educators plan field trips by art theme (Renaissance
era paintings, Native american art, etc.), by event date, and more.

### Target user population
Educators (teachers and professors) in lower-level educational institutions (elementary
or middle school)

Primarily middle/high school students attending museum field trips.

Our team members do not fit into the target populations because we are all:
1. Not middle/high students not going on field trips.
2. Not currently studying art or have an interested in art related topics.
3. Not educators planning field trips for students.
### Real-world data sources
### APIs
For now, we will be utilizing on the Harvard Art Museum API (https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs).

We may add some more different museum APIs to include other museus as we progress throughout the project.
### Additional ideas
1. Could possibly rescope the project to include college art students who actually need specific
art pieces to complete their assignment. Educational aid for college art students.
2. Focus more on the field trip aspect of the project like transpotation, looking for food, safety, etc.
3. Reframe the subject matter (art museums -> national parks/amusement parks/tourist spots/theatre performances) if needed
to capture a different type of audience.

The important idea is that we focus on the concept of making a trip to public places where you can easily get
lost more interactive and easy to access. It wouldn't particularly focus on just the wayfinding; it would include
relevant information to make the trip as seamless as possible.
