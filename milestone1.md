## Project proposal
Our project idea will involve using datasets for art museums across the United
States in an application that can be used by educators to plan field trips.

The data can be used to help educators plan field trips by art theme (Renaissance
era paintings, Native american art, etc.), by event date, and more.

### Target user population
Educators (teachers and professors) in any institution (elementary school,
middle school, high school)

Elementary, middle, and high school students looking for art museum information.
### Real-world data sources
### APIs
### Additional ideas
Resources for people on food assistance / food stamp program participation
## Storyboards and paper prototypes
