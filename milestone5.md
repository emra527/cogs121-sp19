## Relevance to Target User Population 
Museums can have collections that span hundreds to thousands of pieces, lending it to be difficult to navigate and hard to plan especially for large groups. At the same time, museums can house a wealth of educational content that could be useful and influential for students. Thus, we designed an app for educators and students to be able to effectively navigate museums for events like field trips. Through the app, educators can search through pieces in the museum and develop itineraries tailored speifically for their students. Students can then access these plans and share their progress with their teacher. Using the app, teachers can plan museum trips more efficiently and effectively, while enhancing their students' learning.
