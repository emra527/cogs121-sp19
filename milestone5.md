## Relevance to Target User Population 
Museums can have collections that span hundreds to thousands of pieces, lending it to be difficult to navigate and hard to plan especially for large groups. At the same time, museums can house a wealth of educational content that could be useful and influential for students. Thus, we designed an app for educators and students to be able to effectively navigate museums for events like field trips. Through the app, educators can search through pieces in the museum and develop itineraries tailored speifically for their students. Students can then access these plans and share their progress with their teacher. Using the app, teachers can plan museum trips more efficiently and effectively, while enhancing their students' learning.

## Improvements from Milestone 4
Since Milestone 4, we updated the majority of the functionality within our app. For instance, the app now generates a random code associated with particular plans that can be shared with students to gain access to it. This code can be copied to the clipboard so that it can be distributed among students. From there students can view their educators' plan and update their progress as they explore the museum.


## Data Usage

We used the Harvard Art Museums API to provide data about all the pieces in their collection. In the app, users can search for pieces in the museum and view more information about them (name, year, artist, etc.).
