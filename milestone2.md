## Differences from Milestone 1 proposal
We will be using PetsApp v3 as a basis for our project.
It is found at: https://github.com/pgbovine/COGS121/tree/master/petsapp-v3

Based on our TA feedback, we will be continuing with our original idea of the app, and basing it off of both Prototypes 1 & 2.
